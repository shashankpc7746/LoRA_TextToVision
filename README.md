# LoRA_TextToVision

📘 Project: From Language to Light - A LoRA Bootcamp
------------------------------------------------------

This repository documents the progress for the "From Language to Light" onboarding task. It starts with learning the fundamentals of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on text models and will progressively build towards text-to-image and text-to-video synthesis.

This README will be updated as each phase of the project is completed.

=====================================================================================================================================

✅ Phase 1: LoRA Basics - Text Fine-tuning (Completed)
🎯 Objective:
To understand, implement, and evaluate the efficiency of LoRA by comparing it against traditional full fine-tuning on a text classification task.

📝 Task:
Fine-tune the distilbert-base-uncased model for sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset.

📌 What is LoRA?
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique designed to make the fine-tuning of large language models more manageable.

Instead of retraining all the millions or billions of parameters in a large model, LoRA works on a simple but powerful principle: it freezes the original pre-trained weights of the model and injects small, trainable "adapter" layers into the model's architecture (typically into the attention layers). These adapters consist of low-rank matrices that learn the task-specific information. During training, only the weights of these newly added adapter layers are updated, while the vast majority of the original model remains untouched. The final output is a small file containing only the trained adapter weights, which can be loaded on top of the base model to perform the specific task.

⚡ Why is LoRA Efficient? A Practical Comparison
The core of this phase was to practically demonstrate LoRA's efficiency. The script LoRA_Text/train_distilbert_full_vs_lora.py was executed to collect direct comparison metrics.

📊 Results Summary
Metric	                    Full Fine-Tuning	          LoRA Fine-Tuning	          Key Insight
Accuracy	                     87.5%	                      87.0%	                   LoRA achieved nearly identical performance, with only a negligible 0.5% drop.
Training Time	                 1359.41s (~22.6 mins)	      1143.90s (~19.0 mins)	   LoRA was over 15% faster, a significant saving even on this small-scale task.
Trainable Parameters	         ~67 Million (100%)	          ~740 Thousand (1.09%)	   This is the most crucial metric. LoRA updated only 1% of the total parameters.
Final Model Size	             ~256 MB (Full model)	      ~3 MB (Adapter only)	   The resulting LoRA adapter is tiny, making it easy to store, share, and deploy.

📚 What Was Learned
Drastic Reduction in Computational Cost:
By training only ~1% of the parameters, LoRA significantly reduces the GPU memory and processing power required for fine-tuning. This makes fine-tuning large models accessible without high-end, specialized hardware.

Faster Iteration:
The ~15% reduction in training time allows for quicker experiments and hyperparameter tuning. This advantage grows exponentially with larger models and datasets.

Minimal Performance Trade-off:
The experiment confirms that it's possible to achieve performance nearly on par with full fine-tuning while benefiting from massive efficiency gains. The small drop in accuracy is a highly acceptable trade-off.

Portability and Modularity:
The small size of the saved LoRA adapter (~3 MB vs. ~256 MB for the full model) is a game-changer. One can have a single base model and numerous small, plug-and-play adapters for various tasks, which is incredibly efficient for storage and deployment.

🧪 How to Run the Script:

## Activate the environment:
gurukul-lora-env\Scripts\activate   

## Run the training script from the project's root directory:

✅ Phase 2: LoRA for Vision – Image Fine-tuning with Stable Diffusion (Completed)

🎯 Objective:
To apply LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Stable Diffusion model and stylize image generation for futuristic "Gurukul"-themed concepts.

📝 Task:
Train a LoRA adapter on CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 using a small 10-image dataset. After training, generate themed images using custom prompts and the learned visual style.

📌 What is LoRA for Diffusion Models?
Just like in text-based models, LoRA works by freezing the original weights of the UNet inside Stable Diffusion and inserting small trainable adapter modules in selected attention layers (attn2.to_q, to_k, to_v). During fine-tuning, only these adapters are updated — allowing the model to learn a new visual style or task without retraining the full base model.

This results in a compact and efficient model adapter that can be plugged into the original Stable Diffusion model to produce stylized images with minimal overhead.

⚡ Why is LoRA Efficient for Vision Tasks?
This phase demonstrates LoRA’s versatility beyond text models by successfully applying it to large vision diffusion models with only ~0.03% trainable parameters.

📊 Training Summary

Metric	                          Value	                       Insight
Trainable Parameters	   297,984 (~0.035%)	          Only a tiny portion of model was updated
Total Parameters	         859 Million	              Most of the model remains frozen
Training Steps	              10 steps	                  Small dataset, quick experimentation
Sample Loss Range	        0.002 – 0.534	              Typical for very small datasets with high variance
Output Adapter Size	            ~3 MB	                  Highly portable and modular

🧪 How to Run the Scripts:

## Ensure the environment has the required libraries:
pip install diffusers transformers peft accelerate xformers

## Activate the environment:
gurukul-lora-env\Scripts\activate

## Run the LoRA fine-tuning script:
python LoRA_StableDiffusion/train_lora_sd.py

## Then, generate images using the trained adapter:
python LoRA_StableDiffusion/inference_generate.py

Results:
🔧 Trained Adapter: ./lora_output/

🖼️ Final Images: ./outputs/

🧠 Dataset: ./training_data/gurukul_hologram_style/

⚠️ Warnings Noted During Training:

xFormers and triton not available — memory optimizations skipped

AMP deprecated warnings — model still trained correctly and loss converged

📚 What Was Learned

LoRA is Model-Agnostic:
We saw that LoRA can be successfully applied to both text and vision models — requiring minimal compute for meaningful style learning.

Fast and Flexible Style Transfer:
Despite using only 10 training samples, the model could stylize concepts like "hologram tree" and "AI teaching" effectively in under 10 steps.

Tiny but Powerful:
The final adapter (~3MB) gives us a stylized generation ability that normally requires re-training hundreds of millions of parameters.

Easier Deployment:
One base SD model can support multiple adapters for different visual styles — ideal for low-storage apps like mobile or embedded inference.

✅ Phase 3: Visual Sequencing - Image-to-Video Integration

🎯 Objective:

📝 Tasks Performed:
Consistent Folder Management

Automated creation of output directories:
Each new run now saves images in a unique folder like frames_scene_1, frames_scene_2, etc., without overwriting older runs.

Prompt Optimization
